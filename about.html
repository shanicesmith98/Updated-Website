		<div class="about">
			<p>Welcome! My name is Shanice Smith. I'm 20 years old and I'm a born and raised New Yorker. After many years of trying out multiple new technical skills, I became a New Media Technologist. Being from Queens, my diverse environment heavily influences my work, as well as pop culture. Together, they shaped my desire to defy the odds of being successful in the tech industry. I'm included in many underrepresented communities within tech, such as gender, race and sexuality. Rather than feeling like an imposter in these spaces, I envisioned myself as a pioneer. Unity, diversity and celebration of identities inspires me to create content that reflect the people inhabit New York City. Determined to make an impact in my community, I use web development, UX/UI design, game development and 3D animation methodologies to further influence the next generation of underrepresented students in tech to chase their dreams, explore STEAM and use their life challenges as motivation for their goals.</p>
