		<p>
			Welcome! My name is Shanice Smith. I'm a born and raised New Yorker
			that's ready to change the world. After many years of trying out
			multiple new technical skills, I discovered that I'm a New Media
			Technologist. Being from Queens, my diverse environment heavily
			influences my work, as well as the late night Cartoon Network shows that
			flood my childhood memories. Together, they shaped my desire to defy the
			odds of being successful in the tech industry.<br /><br />
			I'm included in many underrepresented communities within tech, such as
			gender, race, and sexuality. Rather than feeling like an imposter in
			these spaces, I envisioned myself as a pioneer. Unity, diversity, and
			celebration of identities inspire me to create content that reflects the
			people inhabit New York City. Determined to make an impact in my
			community, I use web development, UX/UI design, game development, and 3D
			animation methodologies to further influence the next generation of
			underrepresented students in tech to chase their dreams, explore STEAM
			and use their life challenges as motivation for their goals.

			and Glassdoor. It is a web-based application that displays the overall
			culture and representation at major tech companies, with ratings based
			on reports released from the businesses themselves and employee reviews.
			I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to build the main page layout based on
			wireframes produced by my teammates from HackHer413's 2019 Hackathon.
